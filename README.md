# pi-radio
The file I've been messing around with the most is test_rotary_radio2.py. 

The others are legacy code that I'm pulling bits and pieces from as necessary. 

My plan of attack...

Part 1
- Get the rotary encoder to work by turning the volume up and down on one stream
- Switch the rotary encoder over to switching between the streams
- When i hit the end of the list, it goes back to the first stream in the list

Optional 
- have rotary encoder switch cause mpc to play and stop
- add a static sound effect in between each station

Part 2
- Get code to display "mpc current" on a screen

Part 3
- Profit?
